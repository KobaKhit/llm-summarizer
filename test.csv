,,0,0,,"Tbf i think soccer in edmonton is more popular than it appears. Not mls level obviously,  but should be able to support a CPL team. Edmonton fc suffered huge branding issues when they were in the NASL. It was viewed as a borderline semi-pro team that you took your kids soccer team to to see what decent soccer looked like, and that was it. And tbh the level of play didn't really warrant any more interest than that.

When they switched to the CPL, the perception stayed, largely due to the fact that the team was in no place financially to promote itself or advertise. I would be surprised if even 20% of the City was aware that they existed. Without an influx of cash it was kind of doomed to slow death, as it didn't get the same interest as other CPL teams, as they got a significant amount of free advertising from the media around a ""new and exciting Canadian soccer league "".

But the Loyal's FO, which includes Landon Donovan, has been quiet about it because they're legally not allowed to talk about ongoing negotiations. So take their silence to mean whatever you want. I do know that negotiations with Snapdragon Stadium have been tough, as it belongs to SDSU.

Personally, as a member of the Loyal's SGs and STM, I won't switch my allegiance to a random MLS team. And I think I speak for a lot of die-hard Loyal/SD soccer supporters when I say that.

Yeah 20 is completely arbitrary. And if we were to go a little more apples to apples comparison, there are 55 first division soccer leagues in UEFA.

,,0,0,,"I think this is feasible in the future. I can actually envision it, which wasn't the case 10 years ago.

There are already a bunch of SS stadiums in the USL and there's healthy attendance in lower division soccer these days. I would say anything from 5-10k is solid and proof there's a thirst for minor league soccer. It's in the middle of a boom so I don't see this slowing down for a while either.

Long ways to go, don't get me wrong, but we're only really just getting into the first generation of Americans (now with expendable income) who grew up knowing soccer as an entertainment product, in the same way we have viewed baseball, basketball, football and hockey for multiple generations.

The biggest spur on of MLS and soccer in generals growth over the past 10 years has been the addition of Expansion sides. It has captured the attention of a lot of investors and in turn local governments. Soccer is no longer the sport of the future in theory. The money is finally talking.

,,0,0,,"Galaxy already play South Bay-adjacent (Carson). Adding a third team in Inglewood would be way too close. (Though I do believe Galaxy should consider*moving* to Inglewood).

I live on the Westside and anecdotally it feels like LAFC has completely taken over this area. After Dodgers and Lakers, I see LAFC gear the most. Ride the Expo Line to the Banc Stadium on a home game and the trains are packed full of Black & Gold. All the stations from Santa Monica through to Culver City. Besides - there is no available land for a new stadium on the Westside. Not unless it was an insane cost. 

I will concede that perhaps there might be an opportunity in the Valley. Not as expensive as the Westside to build a new stadium.

,,0,0,,"Baseball wise, back in the halcyon days of the sport, the AL and NL were completely separate entities, and the reason there were multiple teams in the big markets was because each league wanted a piece of the big market pie. NYC, St Louis, Chicago, Boston and Philly all had teams in each league. Washington had a team that never did particularly well in attendance, and when the St Louis Browns moved to Baltimore, the Senators left town for Minnesota. Then the Senators v2.0 moved to Dallas. 

The Colts also left for Indianapolis, before being replaced by the Ravens, while the Washington thrived. The Bullets also moved from Baltimore to Washington.

While the big hotels use a lot of water and do have some grass, it's very expensive to do it, and it's all in a closed loop and extremely well maintained to preserve water.

It would probably be a very lucrative deal combining the the attention of both leagues while still maintaining separate independence. They have 18 teams so if each of our conferences got up to 18 teams it would be very balanced.

,,0,0,,"Hear me out:

What if the US Open Cup was a month-long winter tournament hosted in a warmer/southern US city over the course of a month.

* Every team gets a stipend for the month to participate if they make it. Turn it into a March madness like event. 
* MLS and USL teams can use it as a pre-season form setter. Or to get their younger guys minutes. 
* Amateur/semi-pro teams don't have to worry about hosting or traveling around the country and being subjected to these kinds of criticisms. 
* USSF can control the broadcasting (maybe with help from MLS) and quality because it's in a single location. 
* Different cities can host each year so long as they have a couple decent stadiums that could host multiple games per day.

There you go. I just solved basically all the problems with the US Open Cup.

But Toronto FC uses the same hybrid natural grass that many top European sides do to successfully play in wintery conditions and share its pitch with the CFL's Argos.

The context being that Garber and MLS don’t give a flying fuck about the Open Cup, haven’t ever tried to promote it themselves, and are actively creating new tournaments to fill their schedule and pull out of the Open Cup eventually. The subtext of this criticism comes off of years of MLS denigrating the competition and actively deemphasizing it. Don’t tell me it’s just light hearted critique because Garber cares or some bullshit. 

They don’t give a fuck about lower division soccer unless they can fleece a city out of a billion dollar expansion and stadium deal to join prestigious MLS. It’s horseshit from the federation and MLS. We have a grand total of one national soccer competition where everyone is involved, from the smallest town to the largest city; and they’re going to kill it.

,,0,0,,">The context being that Garber and MLS don’t give a flying fuck about the Open Cup, haven’t ever tried to promote it themselves, 

Hate to break it to you, but *it’s not Garber or MLS’ job to promote USOC*. If anything, they’d be doing USSF a favor by stepping in since it’s USSF’s tournament. This is like blaming the Premier League for not doing enough to promote the FA Cup because the FA hadn’t done enough themselves to promote it. We’re all in agreement that we want USOC to thrive, but it’s not MLS’ job to pick up after and fix USSF’s mess.

>and are actively creating new tournaments to fill their schedule and pull out of the Open Cup eventually. 

What evidence do you have to suggest that MLS is trying to move away from USOC? I agree the Leagues Cup is kind of dumb but I’m saving my finalized complaints until we go through it once or twice. 

The American soccer landscape and its relationship to money have a lot of problems but given the relatively small and immature state of the sport in this country, I don’t think too many people at the level of MLS are interested in making a decision that’d hamper the growth of the game at large because they think it’ll make them an extra buck in the short term. MLS’ economic self-interest is to see the sport at large grow in this country, not to sabotage the USOC because they fear it’d distract from MLS’ product (which it wouldn’t) in the short term.",,0,,comment_reply,,0,MLS,mindthesnekpls,t1_jizcy3f,jizedlj,138ts1p,,1683305288.0,,13,/r/MLS/comments/138ts1p/tannenwald_the_full_transcript_of_the_exchange/jizedlj/,2023-05-05 16:48:08,2023-05-06 22:03:52

MLS/SUM were deeply tied together with USSF for the better part of 20 years until the most recent TV rights deal went to Turner/HBO, so for the better part of 20 years, MLS could have helped raise the broadcast quality of USOC matches and pushed it as a product that people should pay attention to. But htey didn't.

In that time frame, MLS somehow wins all the bids to host US WCQs but suddenly doesn't have the power to push for more funding for professionalized USOC broadcasts?

,,0,0,,"I can.

Hosts are selected randomly from among those who bid to do so. Because there are requirements on venues like field size, nearby locker rooms, restrooms, and lighting, lower division teams have a more difficult time finding an acceptable venue with only two or three weeks between rounds. (This is also why second round pairing and hosting decisions are made before round one is even played.)  The weight of this obligation is especially heavy for any third division clubs playing USLC teams, and any amateurs. The small front offices have to do this leg work _before_ their team even plays a game it has a 1/3 or less chance to win.

These amateur and minor pro teams are also pressed for money, so it may make more sense to take the travel allowance than to pay a premium for booking late and possibly not having enough time to advertise the match enough for hosting it to break even.

As a result, third round hosting is often very tilted towards MLS teams. Most are the primary operators of acceptable facilities, and they know well in advance that they _will_ be playing that week, so it's easier to confidently submit a hosting bid.

Out of the lower divisions, USLC teams are obviously the ones most likely to win in the second round and also most likely to have an acceptable venue for the third and fourth rounds, so that helps them prepare and submit acceptable bids. That's why half of them that reached the fourth round are hosting.

Many people, including myself, support lower division hosting priority. For example, if a group for third or fourth round pairings contains an amateur which has bid to host, they are automatically placed in spot A1 (A for first match in the group, 1 for host). If there is a second, draw one for A1 and place the second in B1. Then this is repeated for D3 teams, then USLC. If there are multiple teams from a division which are willing to host and one hosting spot remaining, one is randomly drawn. Only if fewer than half of the hosting spots can be filled by lower division teams will MLS sites be considered.",,0,,comment_reply,,0,MLS,grabtharsmallet,t1_jizizya,jizp52i,138ts1p,,1683309616.0,,10,/r/MLS/comments/138ts1p/tannenwald_the_full_transcript_of_the_exchange/jizp52i/,2023-05-05 18:00:16,2023-05-06 22:03:52

Lol “somehow”??? Where are all these other stadiums you think they should be using? Hilarious to imply that they should say “screw these great new soccer-specific stadiums, let’s play in football stadiums or 12,000-seat USL parks.” Come on.

Isn’t that what Garber is openly and obviously doing here? But it’s not HIS money. He’s not czar of all things soccer in the United States.

,,0,0,,"Never said they did lmao.

Also very clearly never said this. I specifically added the qualifier of *when you factor in international tournaments* on purpose to show the paragraph was an expansion of the point I was making. Which was that USSF, which obviously has outsized influence into venue selection for the Gold Cup being played in USSF-affiliated stadiums, doesn’t have some weird hatred for NFL stadiums lol.

Lastly, I’m not “bitching” about good faith. I was attempting to make a sincere point that people can get overly defensive on the internet because plenty of bad actors troll and debate in bad faith.

,,0,0,,"I mean, they both asked what the problem was and where you would have those games at. You illustrated the influence via the comment about stadium selection, which if you can provide some more on would help your point. For Mexico and Costa Rica, both should be/have happened at a different MLS stadium but your assertion was that other leagues and larger venues are ignored.

> Choosing MLS stadiums and then having the MLS commissioner bitch about the quality of the USOC that he (Garber) and the MLS BOG have treated like a red-headed stepchild for its entire existence is noteworthy for its contradiction.

But how are those the same? The point only works if you believe that the *only reason* that USSF picks just MLS venues is because of MLS' influence. As in, there is no other reason for why TQL or another MLS stadium could be selected for a US match, other than MLS influence. That just isn't true at all, almost all MLS stadiums are pretty much the best we have for soccer-specific venues and I can't think of many that are better, besides Louisville's stadium.

When SUM (basically MLS BOG) were negotiating rights for the US Open Cup, we got a four-year deal with ESPN+. Now, we have games happening either with streaming or random places. I don't see why it wouldn't be good for MLS to have the US Open Cup do better, the tournament is literally the one thing that separates soccer from all the other sports in this country, it is a potential money maker for MLS.",,0,,comment_reply,,0,MLS,EnglishHooligan,t1_jizvc23,jizxq1v,138ts1p,,1683313120.0,,6,/r/MLS/comments/138ts1p/tannenwald_the_full_transcript_of_the_exchange/jizxq1v/,2023-05-05 18:58:40,2023-05-06 22:03:52

I'm happy that engagement is reportedly up. Interest in this tournament has been going up every year since the last ESPN+ deal.

,,0,0,,"Ya that’s all valid I’m glad to hear viewership is way up, though I’d be curious what the source on that is… I don’t think ESPN+ ever released last years data but I could have just missed it honestly.

I’d argue “watchability” is more than just raw viewership though. From my perspective the production in terms of camera angles, number of cameras, bugginess of the service, etc. was much better last year. I also think part of what he’s referring to is the games being on completely random services like B/R or just not streaming literally anywhere (wasn’t the Sac Republic / Oakland game just not available?).
