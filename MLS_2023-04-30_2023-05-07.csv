Yeah, not much different at all lmao 


for a fanbase that split off from Galaxy because they felt too whitewashed / Orange County soccer mom, to garner more blue collar LA residents, that successfully did so, but they’re of a certain majority of type of people……what are you trying to say? Our fans are the best traveling fans in the MLS, we’re loud and passionate, and make games feel like watching international football; is that what he means? and most of our chants are in Spanish, and most of our fans are Latino, with a good mix of other types of LA locals too ……is that what he means? Our #1 striker is from a small section of Africa called Gabon, Opoku is from Ghana, Palacios is from Ecuador, Murillo is from Colombia, Maldo is from Honduras, Cifu is from Ecuador, Biuk is from Croatia, Vela and Duenas are from México, Ilie Sanchez is Spanish, and our US guys aren’t privileged either, hell our goalie is from fucking Philly. I guess he is right, we do represent everything LA, because all these kinds of people live here. Is that what he means?

This fanbase and team does represent the blue collar of LA, but a different kind of blue collar than in Philly, or at least Jim seems to think so. TIL that mostly white soccer fans in Philly are the *actual* blue collar, because the thing most of the actual blue collar people in Philly watch isn’t Football/Baseball/Basketball is…..soccer? 


Next time he should just say what he means and stop beating around the bush. Hope you guys enjoy our version of blue collar tonight",,0,jil38sq

The criticism being that San Francisco fans just go cuz of the fancy new stadium, not real sports fans, etc...

Then like 2 years later... Phillies went from Veterans Stadium to nice new Citizens Bank Park, and attendance jumped from 1.5 to 3+ million... virtually identical situation, but there was no bashing Philadelphia sports fans.

Same era... look at the **76ers attendance** *before* Allen Iverson(Finals run) and after Allen Iverson <--That is the definition of **Bandwagon/Frontrunner/Fair-weather** sports fans.

Not mls level obviously,  but should be able to support a CPL team. Edmonton fc suffered huge branding issues when they were in the NASL. It was viewed as a borderline semi-pro team that you took your kids soccer team to to see what decent soccer looked like, and that was it. And tbh the level of play didn't really warrant any more interest than that.

When they switched to the CPL, the perception stayed, largely due to the fact that the team was in no place financially to promote itself or advertise. I would be surprised if even 20% of the City was aware that they existed. Without an influx of cash it was kind of doomed to slow death, as it didn't get the same interest as other CPL teams, as they got a significant amount of free advertising from the media around a ""new and exciting Canadian soccer league "". In edmonton it was basically ""hey that team switched leagues again I guess""",,0,jj152oy

But the Loyal's FO, which includes Landon Donovan, has been quiet about it because they're legally not allowed to talk about ongoing negotiations. So take their silence to mean whatever you want. I do know that negotiations with Snapdragon Stadium have been tough, as it belongs to SDSU.

Personally, as a member of the Loyal's SGs and STM, I won't switch my allegiance to a random MLS team. And I think I speak for a lot of die-hard Loyal/SD soccer supporters when I say that. Many won't switch over to the new team just because it's MLS. So I think it would be in everyone's best interest if it's Loyal that moves up to MLS. But I guess we'll see what happens...",,0,jj0cbgz

England has a ratio of 1 EPL team per 2.8 million people (20 teams, roughly 56 million people in England).

Now if we do geography...

EPL is 2515.5 sq mi per EPL team.

MLS (US only) should be **1,509 teams** rounding down.

LOL

Yeah 20 is completely arbitrary. And if we were to go a little more apples to apples comparison, there are 55 first division soccer leagues in UEFA. If you whittle that down to the Eurozone and an area closer to the size of the US by eliminating Russia, Turkey, and parts of the Middle East...it is still 40ish LEAGUES.

There are already a bunch of SS stadiums in the USL and there's healthy attendance in lower division soccer these days. I would say anything from 5-10k is solid and proof there's a thirst for minor league soccer. It's in the middle of a boom so I don't see this slowing down for a while either.

Long ways to go, don't get me wrong, but we're only really just getting into the first generation of Americans (now with expendable income) who grew up knowing soccer as an entertainment product, in the same way we have viewed baseball, basketball, football and hockey for multiple generations. The growth curve seems to be far from flattening. I think a big driver of this is MLS's willingness to add new markets over the past decade.

The biggest spur on of MLS and soccer in generals growth over the past 10 years has been the addition of Expansion sides. It has captured the attention of a lot of investors and in turn local governments. Soccer is no longer the sport of the future in theory. The money is finally talking.

Adding a third team in Inglewood would be way too close. (Though I do believe Galaxy should consider*moving* to Inglewood).

I live on the Westside and anecdotally it feels like LAFC has completely taken over this area. After Dodgers and Lakers, I see LAFC gear the most. Ride the Expo Line to the Banc Stadium on a home game and the trains are packed full of Black & Gold. All the stations from Santa Monica through to Culver City. Besides - there is no available land for a new stadium on the Westside. Not unless it was an insane cost. 

I will concede that perhaps there might be an opportunity in the Valley. Not as expensive as the Westside to build a new stadium. And not sure how many fans there are out there since it's a schlep to South Central/Carson. Probably is a small but financially well off fan base to pull from in places like Glendale, Burbank, Encino, etc.",,0,jj1iqx9

Washington had a team that never did particularly well in attendance, and when the St Louis Browns moved to Baltimore, the Senators left town for Minnesota. Then the Senators v2.0 moved to Dallas. 

The Colts also left for Indianapolis, before being replaced by the Ravens, while the Washington thrived. The Bullets also moved from Baltimore to Washington.

I don’t think the average person in Cleveland even knows of the existence of the Columbus Crew (or FC Cincinnati, for that matter).

In regards to professional soccer Cleveland is a desert, I think we are the biggest metro without a professional soccer team at any level (FC Cleveland is semi-professional and is virtually unknown). I know many local soccer fans who follow the Premier League and USMNT, so the interest is there. I don’t think the MLS gets to 40 without Cleveland, the market is too big to skip, but the MLS Next Pro team they’re bringing to Cleveland really is a joke.

It's the lack of relegation plus the lack of promotion -- the latter may be more important.

If you want an MLS team, you need to buy one of 29 owners out or spend like $300-$500M in expansion fees plus a stadium. It's an exclusive club and lots of people have silly money, so you can charge it if someone really wants in.

Someone buying Chelsea or Man U gets the same lift. You can't replicate that. But if you went to buy Brighton, even with their success this year ... there's always the option to buy a Championship squad, maybe in a bigger city, and try to get them up. There are other options to get in the EPL.

That and the US tends to centralize clubs into 30-40 cities as opposed to having one every five miles like England seemingly does.

Further proof there is too much disparity within UEFA for MLS cynics to speak about  Europe as a monolith when they spew their “MLS is not as good as Europe” or “MLS will never catch up to Europe” nonsense.

You're not wrong, and I've often tried to say to people that not only is ""Europe"" not a real economic entity, but ""Liga Portugal"" or ""the Eredivisie"" isn't either.  It's two different leagues depending on whether you're one of the big clubs that qualify for the UCL all the time or not.

But it is also true that MLS teams are more expensive compared to their revenue or their first team roster expense than those non-UCL European teams.  MLS would not be competitive with the next 15 teams on the field at the present moment.  MLS franchise values are essentially based on a) the fact that MLS's financial arrangement saves owners money on the rosters, and b) a bet on future growth.",,0,jithu1k

Pro-rel works elsewhere because teams have deep ties to their communities and a loyal fanbase who will support them in any division. Or soccer is literally the only viable professional sport in their country. There are too many sports options in the US for pro-rel to work.

I also think your example is a little off in that a certain strata of owner really has no worries about getting relegated. Chelsea is probably the worst managed team this year maybe ever -- they are nowhere near relegation. You can buy a certain level of play.

That's why there's going to be a huge gap in the prices for some of these teams. The ones with giant fanbases already are going to be bought by people who don't have to worry about relegation.

But sports teams are weird, and the biggest future cash flow has turned out to be the sale of the team. So you can lose operating money for years on the books, take the tax write-off, etc.

In the meantime, you farm the team for cheap capital liquidity, for perks, for government money and tax benefits, and of course, for the fun of owning a team. But you never actually put your capital at risk because you know someone will buy it!

And hell, because of that, you don't actually need to tie up your money -- banks will lend you huge amounts of cash to buy it at low rates because the collateral is so reliable!

We have a new ""Final Four"" Club Tournament with CONMEBOL/LIBERTADORES staring next year!!!  It already is benefiting MLS.

&#x200B;

>WORLD SOCCER TALK (Jan 2023) - ""Arguably the biggest news of the day. Conmebol and Concacaf have decided to create a brand-new final four tournament between the best teams from Copa Libertadores versus Concacaf Champions League... partnership could be **the most significant development for \[U.S.\] soccer**.  
>  
>The positives for both sides are clear. Concacaf clubs have a realistic chance for more significant games. Of course, to get to this stage, they have to perform well in the Concacaf Champions League. **Success there would help the acceptance of intercontinental soccer in the United States**.Many **soccer fans in the United States** can recognize the names of clubs in South America. Boca Juniors and River Plate are massive. Same goes for Santos, Flamengo, Palmeiras and Corinthians. **Seeing your ‘local’ team compete against those sides for a trophy can develop the fandom of continually growing MLS** sides.

&#x200B;

Reportedly, last year, UEFA had been considering revising their ""Super Cup""(?) so a to include the Champs of MLS, in a four-team tournament. These International Confederations/Club Leagues are fighting over us, they love MLS.

&#x200B;

>The Guardian ( Sept 2022) -- \[MLS teams\] could be invited to take on the \[UEFA\] Champions League winners in a revamped Super Cup being considered by Uefa. Substantive discussions... to replace the Super Cup are understood to be ongoing.  
>  
>This would feature the winners of the **\[UEFA\] Champions League and Europa League** as is the case now, but also the winners of the Europa Conference League. The United States, considered the key growth market for European football, is the main destination under discussion and one option would be to include the host country’s champions – in this case, **the winners of Major League Soccer – as the fourth team**.",,0,jivl3mk

All of the things you have said that are problems with LA are actually the reasons it can be so much more valuable than some European clubs. It has a stadium that only seats 20k people and is a tiny fish with a lot of room to grow in its market, yet is profitable despite all of that.

If they mature the market, start playing in an 80k seat stadium that they can reliably sell most of the seats in, and get an American sized sports TV deal like what the NBA has, LAFC easily would become the most valuable soccer club in the world except for maybe some of the other MLS clubs.

If we were to have our top 18/20 teams play against those leagues in a Big Ten/ACC challenge type event I could see us matching up really well against a couple of those leagues in 10 years. The top 5 or so teams from each league would likely win easily but the bottom half of the non EPL leagues should be competitive. The French league in particular seems to be the weakest from top to bottom. Our lowest spending team should be in the upper half of that league in spending by the end of this decade if not sooner.",,0,jirpmig

How many of these kids will ever put on a senior USMNT shirt, let alone do so at a major tournament? For many of them this is their final shot at taking part in something like this. They’ll remember this for the rest of their lives, certainly more than some random late spring league matches. 

I get Chicago’s position—you don’t want to lose your starters mid-season—but there’s an argument here that giving them an international tournament experience is a development opportunity better than they’d get from the 3-5 league matches they miss. They’ll play against wildly different players from around the world in super high-pressure situations in a highly concentrated environment. You’re not getting that in your weekly MLS routine. 

Also, I love this league, but I’ll say it—it’s just MLS. It’s not like the Fire need these guys to be ready for the Champions League final. It’s early-mid season league matches in MLS.

This team has made the playoffs once in the past 10 years, that's not enough in a sports town like Chicago, where you have teams like the Cubs that literally have a century of history for fans to fall back on

Personally, I would prefer that these young guys show their stuff as international tournaments are great experiences that don't come often as a human, as well as continue their connections with the national team program. But as a Fire business decision, these guys are crucial starters to a team that cannot miss the playoffs again, and has dropped a league leading amount of points from winning positions but yet is outside a playoff spot right now.

And, not to discredit their achievement, but does anyone even remember Ukraine even won the last tournament, or can anyone name a handful of that squad? Youth tournaments aren't nothing, but lets not overrate them as the great driving forces of youth development, otherwise countries like Nigeria and Mexico would be top 5 national team programs right now 

So, if this were a perfect or even solid season, these guys would probably be on that plane. But this season is the 10th last straw for the fans that are still showing up in spite of the on-field results not giving much reason for them to continue. 

If this were only the 3rd, 5th or even 7th season of mediocrity, maybe the fans would be more patient. But this has been more than 10 years of the Fire failing to not be irrelevant in the City and almost the same amount of time of being irrelevant in the league

There are a lot of reasons and a long story of why the Fire are at this point that we could go over, but in the end, it just leads to stuff like me, a random fan who takes out his frustration on an social media website to an innocent guy asking a reasonable question about kids playing a youth tournament",,0,jiwhpmu

Many of these kids have played together for yrs now across the youth teams and imo deserve to finish that off with a World Cup experience after grinding and going through qualifiers. It’s not like they’re missing playoff games, they’re missing a few mid season matches in a super long season. We also have leagues cup and stuff too where they’ll make up the “lost mins”. These absences aren’t going to cost any team a chance at the playoffs. There’s so many teams that make it, if you are gonna be hampered by some 19 yr olds missing a few matches then your team has bigger problems.

Homie, yes it is. If they're over 18 and playing professionally, they're adults. Big clubs aren't looking for long-term prospects at that age, they're looking for guys already embedded in first teams performing like pros.

>An average U20 player is normally still finding their footings at a club and trying to win a starting spot, no?

For players looking to make big club moves? No, they're almost all getting significant minutes if not starting. I think you may not have  a great idea of who plays in these tournaments. Go look at the U.S. U-20 roster from that tournament, most of them were starters at their clubs.

LAFC will likely be dominant in MLS for this era of MLS. Then the rules will change and they will likely adjust well and still be elite. They will likely be a dominant team in a way the league has never seen before. MLS-imo my minority opinion- is now ever so slightly better than LMX. Being the best league in North America to me means I don’t have to root for every league team in a continental tournament. If they get multiple trophies again this year I will be likely more neutral next year. I think LAFC should be favorited against Leon. I want MLS to have a CCL streak like LMX did. If they are the lone MLSteam I will root for them.,,0,jitw7ep

I see you didn't watch the match @ MB, as SJ's Starting XI was made up a majority of players in SJ's 18, with quite a few of this season's starters. They then also subbed on even more starters for half-time and throughout the second half. Ironically it was a miscue by one of those starters that gave MB the chance for a goal.

I agree the tournament needs to raise the bar, as does CCL. But a lot of it comes down to how MLS treats the tournament.

I understand that some grounds have unique issues, like in Portland.

The context being that Garber and MLS don’t give a flying fuck about the Open Cup, haven’t ever tried to promote it themselves, and are actively creating new tournaments to fill their schedule and pull out of the Open Cup eventually. The subtext of this criticism comes off of years of MLS denigrating the competition and actively deemphasizing it. Don’t tell me it’s just light hearted critique because Garber cares or some bullshit. 

They don’t give a fuck about lower division soccer unless they can fleece a city out of a billion dollar expansion and stadium deal to join prestigious MLS. It’s horseshit from the federation and MLS. We have a grand total of one national soccer competition where everyone is involved, from the smallest town to the largest city; and they’re going to kill it.

Hate to break it to you, but *it’s not Garber or MLS’ job to promote USOC*. If anything, they’d be doing USSF a favor by stepping in since it’s USSF’s tournament. This is like blaming the Premier League for not doing enough to promote the FA Cup because the FA hadn’t done enough themselves to promote it. We’re all in agreement that we want USOC to thrive, but it’s not MLS’ job to pick up after and fix USSF’s mess.

What evidence do you have to suggest that MLS is trying to move away from USOC? I agree the Leagues Cup is kind of dumb but I’m saving my finalized complaints until we go through it once or twice. 

The American soccer landscape and its relationship to money have a lot of problems but given the relatively small and immature state of the sport in this country, I don’t think too many people at the level of MLS are interested in making a decision that’d hamper the growth of the game at large because they think it’ll make them an extra buck in the short term.

MLS/SUM were deeply tied together with USSF for the better part of 20 years until the most recent TV rights deal went to Turner/HBO, so for the better part of 20 years, MLS could have helped raise the broadcast quality of USOC matches and pushed it as a product that people should pay attention to. But htey didn't.

In that time frame, MLS somehow wins all the bids to host US WCQs but suddenly doesn't have the power to push for more funding for professionalized USOC broadcasts?

Hosts are selected randomly from among those who bid to do so. Because there are requirements on venues like field size, nearby locker rooms, restrooms, and lighting, lower division teams have a more difficult time finding an acceptable venue with only two or three weeks between rounds. (This is also why second round pairing and hosting decisions are made before round one is even played.)  The weight of this obligation is especially heavy for any third division clubs playing USLC teams, and any amateurs. The small front offices have to do this leg work _before_ their team even plays a game it has a 1/3 or less chance to win.

These amateur and minor pro teams are also pressed for money, so it may make more sense to take the travel allowance than to pay a premium for booking late and possibly not having enough time to advertise the match enough for hosting it to break even.

As a result, third round hosting is often very tilted towards MLS teams. Most are the primary operators of acceptable facilities, and they know well in advance that they _will_ be playing that week, so it's easier to confidently submit a hosting bid.

Out of the lower divisions, USLC teams are obviously the ones most likely to win in the second round and also most likely to have an acceptable venue for the third and fourth rounds, so that helps them prepare and submit acceptable bids. That's why half of them that reached the fourth round are hosting.

Many people, including myself, support lower division hosting priority. For example, if a group for third or fourth round pairings contains an amateur which has bid to host, they are automatically placed in spot A1 (A for first match in the group, 1 for host). If there is a second, draw one for A1 and place the second in B1. Then this is repeated for D3 teams, then USLC. If there are multiple teams from a division which are willing to host and one hosting spot remaining, one is randomly drawn. Only if fewer than half of the hosting spots can be filled by lower division teams will MLS sites be considered.",,0,jizp52i

The problems began on Sunday, when two of those tests came back positive. The team canceled a planned training session that day as a precaution, and everyone was re-tested. “Then on Monday, we still hadn’t received tests back from that Sunday testing, and the league told us we were good to go train,” Hollingshead says. “That is 100 percent the league’s choice and their decision.""

They’re waking up in the middle of the night with their sheets sopping wet with their fever and with the virus. They were calling me, barely even able to breathe.

For the last paragraph, I’ve literally never said anything remotely close to that. The soccer world is run on influence, every governing body has it. My point was, in the context of organizing events played in USSF-associated venues, USSF absolutely has outsized influence into determining proper venues, especially when Gulati is a VP lol.

As far as the USOC is concerned, *of course* MLS has influence, but influence isn’t the same thing as unilaterally making decisions like the other user seems to be expecting from the league.

But how are those the same? The point only works if you believe that the *only reason* that USSF picks just MLS venues is because of MLS' influence. As in, there is no other reason for why TQL or another MLS stadium could be selected for a US match, other than MLS influence. That just isn't true at all, almost all MLS stadiums are pretty much the best we have for soccer-specific venues and I can't think of many that are better, besides Louisville's stadium.

When SUM (basically MLS BOG) were negotiating rights for the US Open Cup, we got a four-year deal with ESPN+. Now, we have games happening either with streaming or random places.

I'm happy that engagement is reportedly up. Interest in this tournament has been going up every year since the last ESPN+ deal.

I’d argue “watchability” is more than just raw viewership though. From my perspective the production in terms of camera angles, number of cameras, bugginess of the service, etc. was much better last year. I also think part of what he’s referring to is the games being on completely random services like B/R or just not streaming literally anywhere (wasn’t the Sac Republic / Oakland game just not available?).

Genuinely curious, what exactly about this model makes it different than say Tacoma Defiance for example? Is it that Huntsville calls itself an ""affiliate"" rather than a reserve side? Or the distance from the home team? They are selling their own merch which is dope and more than Tacoma does (at least online).

Going off Wikipedia they've had 11 Nashville first team players and 3 Nashville academy players on the roster and on twitter they mention Nashville as their parent club. So anyone who pays enough attention knows what sort of team they are, a reserve side.

It doesn't have local independent or shared ownership like past reserve/affiliate USL teams like Reno 1868 (rip) or Rio Grande Valley that could enter into the USOC (tho RGV chose not to). So that's why I'm confused about how anyone will be able to look at the team and see it as more than just a reserve team.

There is a large degree of separation between Nashville, TN and Huntsville, AL, much more that Tacoma/Seattle has. That distance isn’t just literal distance though, it leads to cultural differences, which creates a bigger opportunity for the Huntsville community to actually embrace the team as “their own”, if that makes sense. Tacoma just isn’t far enough away or culturally different enough from Seattle for that to occur at scale imo. 

Beyond that, I genuinely think launching a team from scratch with its own unique branding is unique and will again create a bigger opportunity for the community to embrace it. Tacoma was originally “Seattle II”, so it had to rebrand and attempt to shed that reserve team image. Once you openly declare yourself as a reserve side to the local community, it’s incredibly hard to shake it. Obviously, a lot of fans aren’t stupid and will understand the roster situation, but branding goes a long way towards building community support.

Anyway, there was always a running narrative that the Defiance drew pretty well, especially for a reserve team.

Yeah I went with Tacoma as it's the only reserve currently based outside the city of the MLS team it is under, so that does add to your point about this team being unique for MLSNP.

>  Once you openly declare yourself as a reserve side to the local community, it’s incredibly hard to shake it. Obviously, a lot of fans aren’t stupid and will understand the roster situation, but branding goes a long way towards building community support.

Yeah that's all very fair, it's like how Bethlehem Steel FC started as its own thing, wasn't Philly Union 2 until *after* they moved back to Philly. In USL historically the independently branded/located teams seemed to do slightly better in ticket sales/distribution than those that were straight up reserve sides, so it makes sense.

But the questions come up ... I don't think Ronaldo in SA has really done much for SA football. At least not internationally. Maybe the Qataris are really jealous and that's all that matters, but it hasn't really helped the league at all and probably won't. 

So how much is that worth to the Saudis? At some point, you want to get something for your money.

If MLS can stay competitive ... how much of an allure is Miami, is the US, is the positioning to Messi? On the last, regardless of WHY he actually chooses the place he goes to, Saudi Arabia will 100% be assumed to be simply the money. And while some will think that of MLS, he can absolutely talk about growing the game in the US, being the modern Pele in that respect, etc. 

At some point, you have so much money it feels meaningless but you can't buy public perception as easily. Just ask Elon, who is so desperate for acceptance he comes off as the most insecure man in the world.

The other added hook is while he can buy a team with Saudi money for sure ... he may actually specifically want to be in on a Miami team. I don't know if that's true, but even with his money, he can't really buy a big European team or even necessarily fund a top payroll. But he can have a team in the so-called capital of Latin America in a growing league with equity safety. 

There's some kind of allure there. Course, he could maybe buy his way in anyway.

--------------

At the end of the day, though, people almost always take the money. So I expect Saudi Arabia. And if not the money, why not Barca?",,0,jiq2r9e

The reality is that most high-profile players who get linked to MLS are simply maximizing other offers. If they want bonkers money and red carpet treatment, they go to a Middle Eastern oil club (or China, a few years back). If they want to stay at the highest level of play, they stay in one of the big Euro leagues for a pay cut and somewhat reduced role. Mentioning MLS can leverage pay for those other options, but doesn't maximize either money or competition.

1. It is reported that there are several out clauses in the mls/apple contract if either party is unsatisfied with how the experiment is going. We do not have to simply accept this.
2. It is a near total blackout for anyone who isn't willing to pay premium apple price for an inferior version of MLS. The monopoly means you can no longer watch for free OTA, or with other packages you were already paying for.  This means fewer eyeballs.
3. The coverage is really bad considering the premium price point.
4. Because this is apple, the experience is not only locked behind an individual paywall, but also apple hardware is needed if you want the premium experience. There is no android app whatsoever, the web view is choppy as hell, and multicast will be limited to apple TV 4k boxes. The multicast is absolutely necessary too because...
5. They ruined the schedule
6. ESPN+ did not really have blackouts either, in practice. That service was far cheaper, most people already had it bundled with hulu/disney/cable and weren't really paying anything much extra for it. The coverage itself was much better too. I assume they made a no blackouts offer last year as well, but it wasn't as high a bid as apple. I ***really*** hope someone leaks what that offer was.
7. Despite being more expensive than ESPN, you get 0 other content. Nada. ESPN gave you all of la liga, bundesliga, and a million other sports programs too for less money. 100 bucks minimum for a single league is a terrible deal.
8. The 25 million people who have ESPN for those other leagues were able to casually check in on MLS, now it is hidden from their view and far fewer casual eyes will be on the league. This will really hurt growth, especially leading into the world cup. The only people watching mls season pass are a portion of the hardcore fans.
9. The national broadcasts are rare, fewer games than ever before. You cannot follow the league this way, you just get crumbs.
10. The MLS is not yet a globally popular league like the euro big 5. Keeping MLS seperated from the channels people watch the more popular leagues through in other countries basically ensures they will never see MLS. Nobody in europe is paying 100 bucks a year to watch MLS alone, except maybe jesse marsch. This does not help global growth for the league, it drastically limits it.
11. Apple is literally the greediest company in the country, sitting on more cash reserves than anyone else, over $200b. I do not want to give them anything more. Even with all this money, they intentionally overcharge for EVERYTHING. You can trust them to fuck your wallet.
12. (edit) The positives you list are attributable to the unified league wide contract that MLS spent years putting together. unification is good, having it in the hands of apple is bad.
13. I AM NOT GOING TO WATCH SCHMIGADOON, STOP TRYING TO SCHMIGADOON ME, APPLE.

Bud, the folks at NYCFC and MLS have had no problem with coaches and journalists busting out the tape measures and walking the pitch themselves.

The size of the field is part of it, in that we’re used to playing in tighter quarters because we do it more often than anyone else.

But the other factor is that the touch lines aren’t parallel to the seats. In most stadiums, players can orient themselves at a glance (in relative terms) by comparing their position to the stands. But because Yankee Stadium requires the field to be situated at an unusual angle (to both fit the length and to avoid the pitcher’s mound, which the Yankees won’t let us touch during the field conversions), that method of orientation isn’t available. NYCFC players are more familiar with the landmarks of the place, so they can make runs more confidently than opposition players who can’t rely on their spatial intuition as well as they usually can in other stadiums. 

Maybe you already knew that, maybe you didn’t, but I think it’s fascinating. I love finding out weird stuff about how the game gets played, especially things like this that I wouldn’t have thought about on my own, but which make total sense once they’re pointed out.",,0,jij1gwj

Most stadiums are designed with the stands parallel to the touchlines, whether because it's a soccer-specific stadium, or because American football also uses a rectangular shape for their fields. So when something deviates from that, it can be disorienting. Is it a huge factor? Probably not. Is it a factor at all? Probably. You don't have to be ""focused on the stands"" to have a weird sense of ""that's not supposed to be there"" that causes a momentary distraction.

I'm trying to pull up some sources, but it's hard to search for this stuff, given that ""Yankee Stadium"" is not really optimized to return results for MLS. But here's an older article where Jesse Marsch talked about it: [https://soccerstadiumdigest.com/2015/06/yankee-stadium-for-soccer-good-and-bad/](https://soccerstadiumdigest.com/2015/06/yankee-stadium-for-soccer-good-and-bad/)

As for preseason, who's to say what causes people to be worse? Everyone's a little rusty during preseason, so for all we know, weird practice field sightlines do contribute to slightly worse performances in the preseason, but it's not a noticeable factor amongst everything else involved in tuning up the team before league play begins.",,0,jij6jjw

At the moment, I'm OK with waiting for the regression to the mean - White's not the only one missing sitters at the moment, we're creating a bunch of chances and that will turn into goals.

MLS and Apple are doing this because:

1. MLS knows their biggest target growth audience is Gen Zers/Millenials

2. Apple knows those two generations are cord-cutting in droves, and are often opting to use myriad streaming services in lieu of traditional cable TV.  

3. MLS is a cheaper sports property for Apple to buy into than the NFL or NBA, is less entangled in messy RSN deals than the MLB, and has a way higher growth ceiling than the NHL. 

I think attempting to call this deal good/bad in year 1 of 10 is way too premature, but be interesting to evaluate as this arrangement matures and we reach years 3-5 and many of the production/operational kinks that have been discussed on this thread are ironed out. MLS and Apple also know that they’re far ahead of the curve on fully buying into the theorized TV-to-streaming transition (as more Boomers die out and more Gen Z-ers become adult consumers in their own right), so I think you’d expect it to seem premature for now but grow into itself with time. 

Also, assuming you’re from the Philadelphia, you of all people should know Patty Smith from South Philly isn’t going to pop on PHL 17 and watch Union/SKC when he’s scrolling through the TV while bored on a summer Saturday night. The Union have a different target audience than many of the “cool” teams in the league (Gen X/older Milennial suburbanite families vs. young urban Gen Z/Milennials) which is a separate problem in and of itself, but they definitely haven’t been able to capture the imagination of the average 4-for-4 fan since 2010. Hell, I’ve brought multiple friends to Union games using my season tickets since 2011 (including playoff games!), and while all have said it’s been a fun experience and would love to come back, none of them have started flipping on Union games in their free time. In Philadelphia especially the linear TV approach isn’t successful as a growth engine.",,0,jiz3nbi

I was super positive about the Apple deal when the news broke, but now my gut tells me I'm not alone in having watched much less MLS this season and something about the league feels...colder or dead? I think it's the time slots.

We need more buzz, 2 games Friday Night, 2 games Monday Night, split the rest between Saturday and Sunday and let fans consume recap and preview content for Tuesday-Thursday. Something like that would keep fans engaged.

For all of Serie A you need Paramount+, which is not free. For EPL you need Peacock, which is not free.

>ESPN+ is the same price (or cheaper) and you get all of la liga, bundesliga, and a shit ton more. Last year you got mls too.

ESPN is subsidized by Disney+ and Hulu+Live TV, it's an entirely different product. Is it overall a better value? Sure, if you like La Liga/Bundesliga. ~~You also don't get every Bundesliga/La Liga game - you get a selection of them - seems to be about 50% of La Liga's schedule at least.~~ **Edit: You do get all Bundesliga/La Liga games**

And yes, MLS was on it last year, and got substantially less money from their TV deal - probably a connection there worth exploring, no?

$10 per month for every single MLS game, Leagues Cup, and playoffs is not a bad value no matter what you're measuring for fans of the league. I think they can certainly do a more affordable per-team option to draw a broader audience in, but I guarantee you're going to find extremely few people here who think the $99 price (or $79 w/ Apple TV+, or FREE as a STH) isn't good.

But the fact is that MLS ALONE (where games are on all at the same time for some inane reason) charges just as much as another network that carries far more leagues and far more sports.

How can people seriously think casual MLS audience will grow when they haven't grown at a rate higher than the number of teams in the league over the past 15 years? The fact games aren't on national TV as much anymore is a non-issue.

Seriously, being on national TV and on cable wasn't bringing in any casual fans with the previous contracts.

But neither of those things justifies the price to me. I’ll still pay it because I’m a simp for the league, but I just expected much more in-depth content to be rolled out over time and it hasn’t materialized. If you want that kind of content it’s kind of only available through ExtraTime really, and that’s a free podcast!

The new announcement sucks and is bad for fans and can't be spun in positive light.

It will also still not make me subscribe to this overpriced package. I will not be alone. I will just watch even less MLS games now and ultimately it will disconnect me from the league even more than the current TV deal already has. I will follow it less and less.

There’s at least 3 different windows on Saturdays and there’s like 7 games at 1pm in NFL just like MLS at 7:30 on Saturdays so you can’t watch a majority of the games in pro football either. Plus there’s occasional Sunday matches for MLS too in the afternoon airing which is at least 4 slots. MLS is also going to start having occasional Wednesday night games later in the season too so that’s another time slot that’s coming too, so it’s really not much different 

NFL which is significantly more popular and nobody complains about not being able to see most of the games when their team is playing at 1pm either so I don’t really get the complaints here for MLS. There is a very small minority of folks who watch for several hrs besides their own teams game. A group of people would be complaining about no consistency in start times if they went the other direction too, and also it’d prevent them from doing a flagship show for people to watch like they’re trying to do with the whip around.

There’s pros and cons to both. Something to be said for knowing my team is playing at one of three windows depending where they are and most matches will be 7:30 since I’m on the east coast. Games being randomly at 1 or 3:30 or 5 or 7:30 sometimes just depending on the day is confusing and makes planning tougher for a large segment of fans too",,0,jiyhf5q

That is a big downside. Especially since we were lucky and had two of the best announcers here in town. I really do hope that MLS will set higher standards for their announcers and require better preparation from them before the games so they can at the very least pronounce the players' names correctly.

Yes. But I had already canceled my season tickets, since the value wasn't there. So if I could watch the home games for free and but tickets to a couple of games per year, that would be great.

Now time for, admittedly, my assumption. If ESPN had been willing to do something akin to the Apple deal, it would have either been a standalone cost or the price of ESPN+ would have had to go up. Outside of the games that ESPN produced for ESPN1/2, ESPN+ still relied heavily on local broadcast partners for the actual production of a majority of MLS games. The Apple deal is handling the whole thing top to bottom.

But… they are right. The NBA package comes with blackouts. Not just of home games, but of any game on a national broadcast, which kills a ton of games when your team is good.

Beyond that, you're wrong about the price. League Pass is not cheaper. Their base plan is $15/month, $99/year. That's the same as the MLS package. But you don't get all games, you can only watch on one device at a time (you can bump it up to two devices for an extra $5/month), and there is no family sharing plan.

They never promised 6 games per week free to all. They never specified how many would be free per week, just that some would be free for all and more would be free to Apple TV+ subscribers.

> You only do this if subscription numbers are really low.

Or you do this when you start to put your strategic plan of using MLS to help sell Apple into play by moving some free games to the TV+ package, hoping to up the number of TV+ subscriptions (which they then hope to roll some of those over into Season Pass subscriptions).",,0,jiys939

If you base it on the whole league, as a large chunk of the country doesn't have a local team, then NBA is a better value, by far.

I'm basing on the latter as someone that doesn't live in a market of any pro teams. ESPN+ was an astronomical better value. I got all non-national broadcast MLS games and thousands of other sporting events as well as several of the other top soccer leagues in the world, for less than this MLS only package.

Now with all 14 games kicking off 2-3 hours apart, it is over priced for much of the country. If you live in a team market and your team didn't have free local broadcast (some did) before, then this MLS package may work for you and be a good deal. For a large chunk of us, it is a terrible deal.

NBA league pass (again for out of team market people) gives you a much larger number of games for a much more popular league, for the same price (I mistakenly thought it was a little cheaper).",,0,jiywxmi

But a huge part of the population lives within the blackout zone of what is likely the team they are interested in seeing.

I'm one of the lucky ones in that I don't live where I grew up, so outside of MNUFC I don't live in a blackout zone for the teams I follow. But back when LeBron was back with the Cavs I still missed about a quarter of their games with League Pass because they were on national TV so much.

Even there they are far more Cleveland sports fans in Northern Ohio than there are like me, outside of the market.

At the start of April there was a similar kerfuffle when the MLS schedule didn't list any free games and everyone thought that they were no longer offering free games, and then MLS updated their schedule and the concern died down.

This is the complaint from most people, and the fact that he just given a 5 year extension is where the ownership ties in. If the ownership had any desire to keep the club competitive, an extension that long would never have happened, especially after a less than ideal season last year (which we at least made the best of). But this year, when Vermes is responding ""I didn't hear it, can't do anything about it"" in response to the fans jeering him and repeatedly saying things like ""we just need to stay the course"" after making records of the worst start in league history, it feels like a slap in the face.

I guess it was supposed to be more translucent but the panels got dirty way too fast so the pitch never got enough light. They also said the D2 football games and concerts had way more of an impact than anticipated, which is one reason they stopped hosting them. 

Anyway about 4-5 years ago they got those fancy mobile grow lights and IMO the grass has done a LOT better since then. Still not always great. A big issue is trying to grow good turf in the middle of winter to have it ready for a late February (CCL) or early March (MLS) match.

Be careful what you wish for. Not a lot of coaches have good teams with so many quality players out ... and SKC has way underperformed their xG this year as well. Some of this is bad luck.

We can't play out the back for shit. We can't deal with LAFCs press right now. Would love to know why we don't play Torres or Perea, who've looked excellent in their appearances. 

Lowe for Elliot, Torres for Uhre, Perea for Bedoya/Gazdag. Hell, put in Sullivan. He at least is hungry for it. Glesnes is having a bad performance by his standard. 

I don't know what's holding my beloved Union back. We should have scored 3 in the last leg and possibly 1 in this leg (tough shots, both opportunities). It's like we don't want to score. Or we have 0 points in our luck stat - which is very Philly.",,0,jinh3k4

How does LAFC consistently get bargains? 

1. They're really good at identifying talent!
2. Players view LAFC as a chance to bet on themselves and springboard their career
3. Players will take a cheaper deal because they want to live in LA
4. LAFC auguments the deal with financial or non-financial benefits

Could be 1+2+3 and it's all good, tip of the hat. Or maybe not. Who knows!

Zlatan played for the AEG affiliated Galaxy and then later bought a 50% share of AEG Sweden? How much did he pay? That's a great question! Sure would be interesting to know how friendly of a deal he got wouldn't it? I think if you're crazy if you don't wonder what types of investment deals league players are involved in!

In college football they say if you ain't cheating you ain't trying. LAG and Miami both cheated and got caught. Is LAFC cheating? None of us know.

What I do know is that MLS is an abnormally opaque league of funny money. We've had two financial cheating scandals in the last 2 (3?) years. I sincerely doubt they're alone.

I think it'd be extremely interesting if every team went through a deep financial audit. I'd wager every team skirts the line in small ways. There was comments in some article about teams paying for short-term apartments for new players which is both extremely reasonable but technically not allowed. Don't care about that. The question is which teams step way over the line and by how much.

TBH I also wonder about some of the team friendly deals Sounders players sign. Fredy Montero made his millions so sure he can play for $110,000 if he wants to keep playing. It's not completely unreasonable. But I often wonder if players who go work in the front office after their playing career are making the same as their new peers or if maybe they're getting paid a different rate. Sign a team friendly deal as a player and we'll take care of you down the road when we're allowed. 

Maybe next year Lodeiro will play on a TAM deal and maybe, just maybe, his favorite charity will receive an extra $500,000 donation.",,0,jio30pv

Whitecaps won’t drop that low on the reg, at least not this year. But the team has gotta do better on the field or it’s gonna continue to slip. New $5 menu (including beers) helps a lot but B.C. place isn’t great and tbh gets worse as the temps rise. The stadium is at its best when it’s like 12 degrees and pouring rain.

I agree... MLS is an interesting landing spot for a younger player on the periphery of a Top Five Euro league that maybe hasn't panned out or cannot be sold on to another T5 club for one reason or another. Players on relegation level clubs that maybe don't have good enough stats to be sold to another T5 for a profit, but maybe they cannot afford if sent down, or they at least recoup their investment in. Players from clubs like Schalke, Southampton, Valencia,  Sampdora, etc.  

IMHO, with how MLS has started to establish the league as a viable path to Europe for South Americans, MLS could also be a place for these type of overlooked Euro players. The final piece of the puzzle will be when MLS clubs start poaching Mexican homegrowns before the bottom of the table teams sell them to Chivas/America/Monterrey, etc.",,0,jii3ieb

I just find it odd that Shinyashiki is the first one to even make mention of it and then the club is like ""yeah we know"" and *then* declines to comment on Santos when it's a matter of public record. 

I understand PR is really hard in these situations, but at least offer something more than ""no comment"" is all I'm saying. Well... also just do better at managing the entire organization, but that's a big ask.

EDIT: Not a perfect comparison, but Atlanta was very open and up-front about Almada being a person of interest in a pending investigation in Argentina before they brought him on. They kept everyone apprised of the situation and steps the club was taking in order to thoroughly investigate and vet him as a player and a person. Obviously you can't really do that once a player is on the roster, but the decision a club makes in these scenarios are reflective of the organization as a whole.

Now your excuse was if it had been an entirely different scenario the goal wouldn't have happened. Maybe don't send your fullbacks so high if you don't have players that can cover for them. Also I don't know what formation you normally play but y'all had a flat 4 backline on that goal so 🤷🏽‍♂️ 🤔",,0,jj4mp5i

Ukrainian players (much like the rest of Eastern Europe, frankly) historically very rarely leave the country, which often leads to stagnation, especially since they're only at a handful of clubs. Of their Euro 2020 squad, Ukraine had more players from Dynamo Kyiv alone (10) than they had based outside the country (8). Granted part of that was injuries, but still...

At Euro 2016, they only had 6 players from abroad; at Euro 2012, which they hosted, 21 of their 23 were based in the country (Voronin at Dynamo Moscow and Tymoshchuk at Bayern).",,0,jirc0dh

I think the problem is you still have the perception that MLS is this soccer backwater that no one knows about. It's a very outdated opinion. This isn't 2004. MLS is actually very easy to scout now and is heavily scouted. Top European scouts are all over MLS as evidence by all the transfers. So these players are not going to get known more by playing in an u-20 tournament. They are being scouted right now like everyone else in MLS. 

These two kids will be seeing better, and more importantly, older competition in MLS than this tournament. They will be facing men and not other kids.

For example, top seed in the west plays bottom seed in the east. Preferably in two legged ties.

MLS is a single entity structure… MLS owns all the teams, and holds all the contracts. The “owners” have bought from MLS the exclusive rights to operate the individual clubs.  Yeah, as an owner you can put those rights up as collateral, but I couldn’t put a MLS team up for collateral the same way the individuals/groups/corporations that own MLB teams can.

I have to imagine that the structure allows MLS to revoke those rights under some conditions- otherwise there’s no effective difference in owning the club and owning the operating rights, and MLS would lose its ability to assert ownership when it needs to enforce policy.  And if MLS can revoke those rights if the bank comes calling to collect, what was the team worth to the bank as collateral in the first place?

Banks do not want foreclosed homes. They certainly do not want the assets on a failed business. Is that financial recompense? Usually to some degree, albeit always less than if the loan were just paid. Worse, they have to actively *deal* with all the stuff they get. So a bank is far more likely to work with a billionaire's legal team to work out forbearances, restructuring, or whatever payment allowance enables the customer to escape as intact as possible and the bank to get as much actual repayment there. Well, I only speak from the personal experience of one bank, but I can't imagine they're going to vary that much.

you can't just say ""we dont know shit"" as a cop out for not drawing conclusions lol. im a business owner who's opened many lines of credit and done many VC deals, just because something is an accepted procedure doesnt mean you can't infer whats going on.

just like every person replying to the tweet, its fishy as fuck. the A's are being moved to Las Vegas. this loan timing is before that announcement, but paired with that news, it absolutely makes sense that fisher has 'given up' on his two properties in the bay and this was a way to float cash without him needing to open his pockets for long enough until he could move the A's. now whether or not the earthquakes were just added on as leverage is unknown and is the entire point of my speculation, because as im sure you also know, there are rumors that a MLS club is being shopped and prepped for relocation and the earthquakes are on many peoples suspected shortlist.

and yes, as others have pointed out, past MLB club owners have been forced to sell for doing something similar. this behavior is very zero sum and some owners won't be happy about it. like i said, id be very surprised if other club owners were going around doing the same thing, especially when other club owners were going to extreme lengths to get creative about cash raises (e.g sounders).",,0,jimsuyr

Unique rules are 7-per-side including GK, 65x45 yard fields, 18.5x6.5 ft goals. Will utilize Elam Ending - games are two twenty-minute halves, followed by an untimed period where teams aim to meet the Target Score (+1 goal from what the leading team had at the end of regulation). I.e. if the leading team is up 5-3 at the end of regulation, the target is 6 and they play untimed until one team reaches it.

There are also no throw-ins (just kick-ins), no offsides, and obviously with the rules above, no draws.

#Group A

Accidentally founded in 2017, Prideraiser is an annual, grassroots initiative where supporters groups do fundraising for local LGBTQ+ orgs and bring new fans into our clubs through outreach to the community. The effort is organized through our free platform, prideraiser.org, where SGs have raised more than $680,000 for local charities to date.  
  
Our volunteers are ramping up for the June 2023 campaign, and we invite you and your SG to sign up! Our About page explains everything a SG officer might want to know. If anyone has questions, I will be monitoring this thread all day.",,0,jioy5g3

> Former Utah Royals head coach Craig Harrington was found to have been employed by a Chicago youth soccer club as director of coaching despite being in the midst of a two-year NWSL suspension for inappropriate conduct and sexual comments made to players. The club, Chicago Empire FC, was a youth affiliate club of the Chicago Red Stars until 2021 and has ties to Michelle Lomnicki, who was the NWSL club’s general manager until she was fired on Friday morning. 

An additional detail:

>The NWSL team was unaware of Harrington’s role with Empire FC until contacted by The Athletic in the course of reporting this story, and felt the trust had been broken with Lomnicki.

But I find this part to be sadly hilarious:

>The president of the IWSL, Flo Dyson, confirmed to The Athletic when reached by phone on Thursday that Harrington was disqualified through January 2025 from participating in the league. She expressed multiple times that she did not want the IWSL mentioned in this story.

It also has to do with how you switch up tactics against a specific team. You want to try and target their weaknesses and counter their strengths. You also want to try and switch things up slightly with your own squad. Maybe a slightly different formation to overload a part of the field you want to exploit in their formation or to help protect against a strong attack. 


But SKC has been running with the same tactics for like 10 years. Always a 4-3-3 formation. Lots of possession, slow build up in the attack, use your defending backs to press up the wings and deliver effective crosses. But this leaves you vulnerable to quick counterattacks, as your RB/LB have ventured forward in the attack, leaving just the 2 CBs to defend. Meaning you need CBs with serious speed and quick decision making skills. Something that we've lacked since Opara left and Besler started to slow down. There's more to it of course, but that's the basics. Now everyone has gotten used to it and has gotten better at defending against it and finding a counter-strategy. Evolve and survive. SKC hasn't kept up.


But again, I don't really know what I'm talking about. I'm open to any additions.",,0,jinujtt

It mostly resembles the same team, but they’ve evolved here and there.

The talent pipeline is the bigger problem. 

From 2008-2012, they drafted Chance Myers, Roger Espinoza, Matt Besler, Graham Zusi, Teal Bunbury, CJ Sapong, and Dom Dwyer. ALL their picks from 2016 on have combined for 2 MLS appearances, a GK appearance who gave up 6 goals in a meaningless match 34 and 4 minutes from Chris Rindov this year. No one builds from the draft anymore, but they aren’t getting anything. 

Then after successfully recruiting guys into the academy (Sallioi from Hungary, Busio and Lindsay from NC) they haven’t been able to continue that.

They nailed a couple domestic reclamation projects (Opara, Benny). Not for a long time.

And they used to crush obscure international signings (Uri, Ilie, Collin). They were great at plucking guys from second divisions. As the league has improved, it seems like they’re just getting lesser first division guys.

The team now seems like it has a lot of fine players, but they’re all just kind of role player ish or can’t stay healthy.",,0,jisa1nx

- they were good at the draft and as the draft became less important they were hurt more than most teams.

- they got somewhat lucky on reclamation guys

- they were good at finding players that fit the the old MLS salary structure and not as good at the higher level of salaries. someone like Erik Thommy is probably better than Uri in real terms, but he is not better relative to the competition that Uri was.

First, I prefer not feeling like I have bulk on the legs.

If we wanted the status quo to continue there were examples in the past where we didn't have a robust men's professional soccer league that lasted as long as MLS and USL and new teams never seem to come into reality despite the contrary now.

No cities, even small to mid-size cities like Lexington and Pawtucket, will approve of any soccer stadium plan and long-term infrastructure improvements if they are sent down to the minor or amateur leagues after a bad season. Good luck convincing local governments otherwise.

That's one of the reasons why the pro/rel topic won't extend past small talk conversations. There's plenty of professional soccer teams that do invest, *as long as there's assurance of investment without pissing off local governments, TV rights-holders, sponsors and fans.* 

In conclusion, there has been change over the last 30 or so years, and new investment by means of expansion has been almost a yearly occurrence.

That's nice, but the majority of them can't achieve a return on their investment, and we should be doing far better than less than a hundred clubs in a country the size of Europe. And yes, ""the pro/rel topic"" you so despise is part of the discussion as to how to fix that, and yes, that's how you get municipalities on board, and no, I won't apologize for bringing it up when appropriate, such as when the topic is how to incentivize investment in domestic soccer.

How would you know? They don't have to disclose their financials to anyone. However it is a known fact that if teams own and/or operate a soccer stadium, the team controls the revenue coming in. 

>And yes, ""the pro/rel topic"" you so despise is part of the discussion as to how to fix that, and yes, that's how you get municipalities on board, and no, I won't apologize for bringing it up when appropriate, such as when the topic is how to incentivize investment in domestic soccer.

This would've been the case if we had 100 or so professional soccer teams 150 years ago that the Powers that Might Be decided to organize them into divisions. What we have now also incentivizes investment in domestic professional soccer. By expansion. 

>Finally, don't fucking tell me you can't fund stadiums in an open system when my team was never able to get funding for their stadium specifically because they would ""never be in MLS"". Teams at the non-MLS level being able to say to municipalities that they can become major league is how stadium projects like Indy's and Louisville's become the norm rather than the exception.

That's not always the case anymore. Pawtucket and Lexington aren't using the MLS carrot for public assistance. They both got their stadium plans approved by marketing themselves as professional soccer teams. There's bunch of other examples too, in Colorado Springs, Memphis, Pittsburgh, Hartford, etc. 

> Your focus is on protection for billionaires, my focus is on how to best fund infrastructure across the board, not just for those already lucky enough to be allowed into the monopoly.

Steady, indisputable growth is better than unattended consequences. All these professional soccer teams are running as efficient businesses. Without assurance of professional soccer investment, municipalities won't take stadium proposals seriously. You won't find that many municipalities that would agree on such proposals if you also want to force teams to go down after a bad season. This is why a soccer stadium was built in St. Louis for a MLS team, a stadium in Louisville for a USL team, a stadium in Colorado Springs for a USL team because of that professional soccer carrot, not relegating them to minor or amateur soccer.

If pro/rel is installed one day, it also will be the last day teams will stop receiving any help from municipalities.",,0,jihfkul

In terms of on field success, I don't think the league is shy about its goals of being among the top leagues in the world. TV numbers don't achieve that on their own, but you know as well as I do high viewership means more revenue which buys better players. If MLS was getting NHL level viewership (which isn't too far off) with TV revenue to match, teams could more than double salaries and be just below the big 5 leagues.

That could also just speak to the strength of those fan bases and the rivalry itself.

It made me curious what the numbers are for every game:

MD1: Nash/NYC - 390k (430); 
MD2: FS1 only; 
MD3: LAFC/POR - 317k (430); 
MD4: CLT/ATL - 323k (Noon); 
MD5: SEA/LAFC - 282k (400);

MD9: El Traffico - 328k (430); 
MD10: Nash/ATL - 270k (200)

Excluding MD1 for being an obvious outlier, the 730 games still do slightly better overall. MD3 & MD4 do seem like outliers as well though, so it’s probably also heavily dependent on matchup (CTL/ATL rivalry) or the early season games were benefitting from an early season bump locally (“1st game on TV!”).

You can pretend that's speculation but it isn't. I guess what the league considers success in the short term is up to speculation because they aren't as vocal about that.

What the league considers bad TV ratings IS speculation. They have more data so they could be happy or pissed off with the current ratings. Regardless its not controversial as a fan to want better ratings so the league could've earned more money and in turn spent more on better players.

MLS,"#Lower Leagues

While our subreddit focuses primarily on MLS content, we've always been a home for all U.S. and Canada soccer content at all levels. From the National Teams, to the CPL, to USL, NISA, and the many amateur adult leagues and NCAA - there is a huge amount of soccer available in our countries aside from MLS. Here are some discussion points to guide the sharing of what makes the Lower Leagues amazing and what you'd like to see for them, or from them, in the future:

* Do you support a lower league team either exclusively or in addition to an MLS club? If so, who and why?

* Do you watch or are you interested in watching lower league soccer? How do you find the quality of play?

* Is there anything you'd like to see the lower leagues do in an attempt to differentiate from MLS or innovate in the sport in our countries?

* Do you have a specific memory to share related to lower league soccer? A memorable USOC run or something from the leagues themselves?

As a reminder, submission rules are relaxed around this topic - so if there's a specific aspect you really want to focus on as its own post, please do so!

I'm obviously got a bit of a bias, but I think the USL's best path is finding more Albuquerques: markets that MLS probably is never going to look at and that probably won't get that billionaire whale, but have a *really* strong grassroots support and less competition from other pro teams.",,0,jibzg88

The quality on the field leaves a lot to be desired but I don't watch lower leagues for great soccer; I don't watch MLS for great soccer. I watch because I'm interested in the growth of the sport and the pure chaos that is the lower leagues. To differentiate themselves, I'd like to see USL market itself as the only non-major league controlled minor league in the country and then building to begin pro/rel between their tiers. I have a lot of favorite memories involving lower league soccer. The USLC final between Orange County and Rowdies, the first time my home town hosted a USOC match, celebrating with my team, Jacksonville Armada, after we went undefeated in 2022, driving up to Charleston for a Rowdies away game, etc. If I were to try to convince someone to pay attention to the lower leagues I would tell them that it is the most direct and personable way to interact with the sport.

I'm a New York Cosmos supporter 'til I die, but I do root for RBNY to do well and will unless we're in the same competition/playing each other (which, lord knows when that'll happen again). I have a close friend/roommate who's a big RBNY fan, and I've never had any enmity toward the MetroStars/Red Bulls. I just got into club soccer late in '09, and less than a year later the Cosmos initiative was launched so I latched onto that instead.

>Do you watch or are you interested in watching lower league soccer? How do you find the quality of play?

Love the non-MLS game, and while I recognize that the level of player is higher in MLS (obviously, objectively), I genuinely don't see it as too different (though I chalk that up as much to anything as my own lack of tactical acumen/scouting ability).

>Is there anything you'd like to see the lower leagues do in an attempt to differentiate from MLS or innovate in the sport in our countries?

Um.

I firmly believe an open system is needed in order for American soccer to reach its full potential - that the closed system is American soccer's biggest problem because it disincentivizes domestic investment and screws over the majority of clubs in this country (and their fans). I also believe a more open system would lead to way more clubs, and way more free-to-play academies, offering a huge boost to the national team player pool.

I also want to stress that I'd take whatever form a more open system comes in. It could be traditional pro/rel to and from MLS (Never gonna happen!), pro/rel in an alternate Division 1 with CCL spots and a television contract in the USL (Actually feasible if the USSF were persuaded to do it!), to even just issuing divisional licenses on a per club basis rather than a per league basis ([My own little pet idea](https://old.reddit.com/r/MLS/comments/7l298z/murray_if_mls_passes_over_sac_again_they_need_to/drix8ra/?context=3)).

So to answer the question directly, I'd like to see the USL push for PLS reform to offer a much-needed alternative to what I view as MLS's monopoly on D1 soccer in this country.

I find myself putting on more USL-L1 matches than USL-C games on ESPN+. I’m not sure why. I think there’s definitely a growing gap in quality between mls and USL, but I’m not bothered by it. I think it’s more important that these clubs are connected to their communities than fights over whether one league is x% better than another league. I also think the bottom of USL-C and the top of USL-L1 is closer than most people appreciate.

For my unreasonable pipe dream for the lower leagues, I wish we had a strong and competent federation than ran each division rather than separate leagues slicing up different divisions. Slightly less pipe dreamy is that I wish all independent D2 and D3 teams were consolidated under USL, that the nisa teams that can be professional could be part of USL, and that USL would make reasonable adjustments to its perspective on territory rights. And no independent teams in mlsnextprowtfbbq!

I know you can’t just wave a magic wand, but I want to see USL-L1 triple in size and be properly nationwide, rather than a southeast focused league with a few random clubs elsewhere in the country. (And I have a long wish list for cities for league one. Haha).

I also think there’s a big gap between amateur / D4 and professional / D3 that’s not being well served in this country — this is where NISA seemed best positioned with NISA Nation to “incubate” amateur teams and give them full year seasons and higher competition, but that mostly fell apart. But the question of “how do we as a country help well run amateur teams explore professional paths / futures?” is not well answered in my mind.

My favorite lower league memories are the 2014 USL playoffs — sac republic’s semifinal win over Los Dos (with major “beat LA” kings-lakers vibes, along with “MLS” chants when we thought we’d be joining soon after Orlando), followed by the championship over Harrisburg city islanders.

That got me hooked on lower leagues ... and then the next year it was announced that my hometown of Madison was getting a pro team of its own!

*Do you support a lower league team either exclusively or in addition to an MLS club? If so, who and why?*  
Exclusively Forward Madison in USL1, and somewhat more casually San Diego Loyal in USLC, since that's where my wife's from and we have family there and visit often. I watch MLS sometimes, and like MNUTD and Chicago Fire but wouldn't say I'm an ardent supporter of either. I also host the Talkin' Flock podcast, one of two regular podcasts surrounding the Madison club.   


*Do you watch or are you interested in watching lower league soccer? How do you find the quality of play?*  
I spend my Saturdays with EPL in the morning and USL1 in the early evening and  USLC west coast games at night. The quality of play is good, and usually quite even, which makes the games entertaining even if you're not seeing UCL level bangers and whatever. Beyond the quality of play, though, the fan experience is much better than MLS, I think. The club and the players and coaches are just more embedded in the community. When we travel for an away match the players come and genuinely thank us after the match. Players come hang with us in the bar inside the stadium after home matches. It's just a really cool connection that you don't really get at the top flight of any sport.

  
*Is there anything you'd like to see the lower leagues do in an attempt to differentiate from MLS or innovate in the sport in our countries?*  
I mean, pro/rel, I guess, but I can understand the many barriers to that. There was some talk a couple years ago of a USL-specific Leagues Cup which would be pretty fun. With or without pro/rel I'd rather see it more pyramid-shaped, which means more teams in USL1 and fewer in USLC. If there were pro/rel, I'd say all expansion teams, regardless of market size or whatever, should be required to join USL1 first and earn promotion. I'm also sympathetic to the NISA argument against exclusive territorial rights being a thing, though I'm not well-versed enough in the issue to have a really strong opinion.

  
*Do you have a specific memory to share related to lower league soccer? A memorable USOC run or something from the leagues themselves?*

So many. The first-ever home game had to be delayed a half hour to plow the snow off the field.

In Madison's first season of existence, we entered the USOC and first beat an Open Divsion side (the storied Milwaukee Bavarians) and then went to El Paso and beat Locomotive 3-0. Lost to St Louis SC the next week but still earned the $25,000 for being the last D3 team standing. Very cool. Last year we hosted Minnesota United and lost 2-0 in a miserable cold rain. It was really fun having 100 or so of the Wonderwall & Bucket Hat Brigade folks in our stadium. 

Also there was a home game in that inaugural 2019 season retroactively called ""Messed With Texas"" ... league leaders North Texas SC (the FC Dallas 2 team) came in and we beat them 4-1 .... we don't discuss how Ricardo Pepi and Ronaldo Damus and so many other guys sat that one out that North Texas had only like 3 subs available and a 38-year-old coach playing midfield

Also that season JC Banks (son of USMNT legend Jimmy Banks) scored the only goal vs Lansing Ignite to get us to the 2019 playoffs ... haven't returned since.

2) there is definitely a quality drop off in broadcast and play. Understandable since your avg player pay is 40-60k and broadcast isn’t much. Doesn’t mean it isn’t fun though. 

3) there are only a few more markets MLS can expand into before it becomes the land of diminishing returns, which is 32 and at most 36 teams. USL-C I think can take the rest of the markets/metro areas that are 1,000,000+ and really grow as an independent entity. It probably won’t challenge MLS for D1, but if they can average out 15-18k per match and land a decent media deal and sponsorships, a closed pro-rel system between the MLS and USL-C can be a possibility, or if anything, the USOC becomes a *very* big deal.",,0,jj222x8

I agree. Although that won't make the ""USL to D1"" crowd happy who never got any traction with the NASL and now have moved toward championing the USL in their eternal quest to slay the MLS dragon.

In reality, like a ravenous beast, MLS is going to keep gobbling up all the big markets left. San Diego, Phoenix, Las Vegas, Detroit, Indianapolis, Jacksonville, San Antonio, Sacramento, etc.

So the USL will have to survive by thriving in markets that MLS will never go to. It also helps if the market doesn't have pro teams in other sports. Albuquerque and Louisville are the perfect USL markets. It doesn't help with TV, but significant TV money is something the USL is never going to see.

Frankly I think it's not appropriate to make a 1:1 comparison between the two. The modern USL started play around 2012 I think? So better to compare USL-C to MLS circa 2007 or so. I'm not making a claim that they are/were on equal footing 10-12 years into their respective existences, but probably less dour that comparing USL/MLS circa 2023 would imply.",,0,jie7nq2

I need to have a real connection to teams I root for, and for the most part that's just come from growing up in Mass and watching those teams. I just don't get what people get out of choosing a random team in England or wherever to suddenly become a supporter of. I tried to get into the premier league at one point and just chose Tottenham as a team because Dempsey was there at the time, but I just could not get invested. 

Same way I just don't get bandwagon fans across US sports. Like, how do you just leave one team and start rooting for another because they're better? I just don't get the appeal. Half of what makes sports satisfying to me is the full journey. The heartbreak makes the success matter. Just jumping around following success just doesn't make sense to me. 

I guess this isn't really directly about the lower leagues, I can get following those a bit more because it's mostly people having a close MLS team and a closer USL team, and rooting for both seems reasonable at least, but I still don't know if that's something I could do",,0,jicecw7

I think the apple deal so far has had a negative impact on the growth of the league and caused non apple people like myself to watch less MLS this year than ever before. This sub can downvote me all you want but the fact that theyre already panic pulling the supposed free games tells me the numbers are dog shit and the apple deal is not off to a good start. I already called and cancelled yesterday myself. Gave it a shot bc i love MLS but had nothing but problems and apple support was a joke. No help at all. Asked me if MLS was baseball lol fucking clown show.

Ive hated this deal ever since it was announced and only grown to hate it more as the seasons gone on. How so many of you thought that hiding MLS games behind a subscription within another subscription was a good idea ill never understand lol mind boggling decision by the league and i hope they find a way to get out of it early bc this shit fucking blows.",,0,jj4jsgx

MLS,"Welcome to the **Weekly /r/MLS Questions/Free Kick Thread**.  This thread is designed to house questions/discussions users might have including:

* Help you decide which team to follow if you're new to the league

* Provide information about how to watch MLS matches, and whether or not you should buy ESPN+

* Understand the CBA, league roster rules, drafts, waivers, or other MLS concepts

* Learn about some of the unique qualities of the US Soccer pyramid

* Allow discussion of dead-horse topics that would typically be removed (pro/rel, re-alignment, etc.)

* And other basic/frequently discussed topics

Our usual ground rules:

1. Questions that are covered in the FAQ, Newcomer's Guide, or league site are fair game, even if they are marked as ""dead horse topics"".

2. Questions can be about MLS, lower U.S. or Canadian divisions, USMNT/USWNT, or any club or domestic competitions those teams could play in.  Questions about how soccer works as a sport are fine too! Questions solely about the European leagues or competitions, on the other hand, are not.

3. If you're answering a question, be extra sure to follow our community guidelines: thought out and rational comments, backed up with supporting links. Try not to ""take a guess"" at an answer if you're not sure about the answer. Do not flame, troll, attack fans of other teams, or attack opinions of others in this thread. If you can't be friendly and helpful, don't post in this thread.

4. This is meant to be a helpful Q&A/Discussion thread. This is not a place to practice your comedy bits; avoid asking joke questions or providing joke answers. This is also not a place to dump random articles, links, or opinions about the league.

5. Despite us posting these on Fridays, the thread stays up all week. If it's Wednesday and you have a question, you don't have to wait until Friday to ask it.

6. This is not a ""Free Talk"" thread. Comments about whatever is going on in your personal life or hot takes about non-soccer-related topics are not appropriate. As always, /r/MLSLounge is there for your small talk.

Even though we want you to ask questions, here are some resources that we always recommend reading because they can also help:

Since each team plays 34 games a season, I thought if playing each team in their conference twice (home and away) didn't fill up that 34 game quota for a team, then any remaining games would just be played with some teams from the opposite conference. 

So why is there a third El Trafico this season, instead of, say, LA Galaxy and LAFC just playing against some team from the opposing conference? I mean, more El Trafico, so I don't mind, but I'm curious!",,0,jiypgpb

I’ve seen several people use Wrexham’s success and American athletes and celebrities investing in Championship clubs as proof that MLS will never be successful unless it implements pro/rel. I think it’s obvious that celebs aren’t buying into lower-league British clubs just because they love pro/rel so much - it’s because they want the possibility of raking in EPL TV money without having to pay Saudi Arabia-sized sums of money to buy established PL clubs. If they were so attracted to the idea of pro/rel on its own, they would be buying 3rd tier clubs in France, Portugal, or Brazil instead of the ones that just so happen to belong to the same pyramid as the most profitable league on Earth.

I’m not even against implementing pro/rel in the US, I just think people are intellectually lazy about why they think it would work here. It’s a much bigger priority to get MLS up to the tier just below the Top 5 leagues than to haphazardly add pro/rel and have relegated clubs fold and newly promoted clubs playing in minor league baseball stadiums all to play in a league people don’t care much about anyways",,0,jikq9s1

Look up Sporting KC. Go to stats and filter by minutes played this season. Look at the career history for the top 11 players. Then do the same for Wrexham. 

It would be an absolute bloodbath if the two teams played each other in a competitive match.

Sporting KC's top 11 players in terms of minutes played so far this season features a 28 year old with nearly 100 top-flight appearances in France and Turkey, a 26 year old who's played for Hungary in WCQs, a 28 year old with 100 Bundesliga appearances, a 33 year old with 125 La Liga appearances, and a 33 year old with nearly 300 appearances combined in the SPL and EFL Championship. That's not even including a guy like Tim Leibold who just signed with SKC after racking up 150 2.Bundesliga appearances and 30 Bundesliga appearances. 

Wrexham's top 11 players in terms of minutes played, on the other hand, features a grand total of 8 Premier League appearances totaling ~250' from about 10 years ago. Aside from that, the most impressive resumes feature a few unproductive stints in the Championship from a few years ago. The majority of Wrexham's contributors have very little, if any, meaningful production above the League Two level. Of course you have 40 year old GK Ben Foster with nearly 400 PL appearances and 8 English caps to his name, but he's not going to provide much help.",,0,jilfuk8

Yes, Wrexham's popularity has everything to do with promotion/relegation. It's the dream of moving up--and the agony of not moving up--that makes the story compelling. That's 99.99% of the story.
